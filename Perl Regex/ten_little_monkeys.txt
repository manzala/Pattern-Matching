10 Little Monkey’s

There were ten in the bed,
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and one fell out.
“Ooooooooooh!”
Splat!

Then there were just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
Nine in the bed ...

Then there was just one in the bed,
And the little one said,
"Hey! Where did everybody go?
Mom! Dad!
I want to sleep in your bed!"

1 + 2 + 3 = 6
